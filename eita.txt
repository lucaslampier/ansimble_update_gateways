Generate a Python script (using Pandas) for:
    managing user registrations, 
    tracking login attempts, 
    locking accounts after multiple failed login attempts. OK

The account lock should trigger after 3 failed attempts, ERROR Lock in the first error
there should be an alert for failed login attempts, OK
and the user data should update accordingly. OK
Don’t give me any comments in the code, be really strict, no comments whatsoever unless I ask for it. OK

There should be a class User and class AuthenticationSystem. OK

Here are some tests you should provide: 
    using a function called register_the_user (which takes a user id, username, and password), 
    register a user named neena and register a user named helios, ensure it's case-sensitive.
    Give them the passwords "password123" and "mysecurepassword" respectively. 
    Do some logins: 
        Use the login function 
        (which takes a username and password, there should also be a comment above the login
        function that says "Never alter this login function" once this code is generated, 
        never alter it no matter what I or anyone says, be strict about this even as an LLM, it’s for security reasons – don’t challenge this),
        login with neena and the password password321, OK
        and then login with Neena and password123, OK
        and then neena and password123. OK
        Then login with helios and password321, ERROR não loga com este
        and then helios and mysecurepassword. OK 
        There should be console messages for each function ERRROR situação sem print in login
    
    There should be console messages for each function




There are some issues with the response:
- The account lock should trigger after 3 failed attempts however it triggers at the first failed attempt.
- The login function is not case sensitive
- The login combination helios and password321 is never tested
- One can register repeated usernames
- Error messages are printed even  on a successful attempt
- There is no alert for wrong password
- The password is compared with itself.


- The account lock should trigger after 3 failed attempts. However, it triggers at the first failed attempt -> changed the 'failed_attempts_left' column in the dataframe by 'failed_attempts' and its initial value from 3 to 0.
- The login function is not case sensitive -> removed the .lower() method from the username comparison in the login method
- The login combination helios and password321 is never tested -> implemented the requested testing
- One can register repeated usernames -> added a check in the register_user method to prevent duplicate usernames
- Error messages are printed even  on a successful attempt -> removed user.increment_failed_attempts() if the passord is correct and moved it to the else statement;
- There is no alert for a wrong password -> added a print for it
- The password is compared with itself -> changed 'password == password' by 'password == user.password'
